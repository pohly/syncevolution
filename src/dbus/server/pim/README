Overview
========

The code in this directory only gets compiled when SyncEvolution is
configured with --enable-dbus-service-pim. It uses libfolks and the
PBAP backend to implement a unified address book. This additional
functionality is provided via the org._01.pim D-Bus API.

That API is independent of libfolks and SyncEvolution. That it is
implemented inside syncevo-dbus-server merely simplifies the
implementation, by reusing some code provided by SyncEvolution
and the core Server class:
  * C++ D-Bus bindings
  * logging
  * D-Bus server life cycle control: delay shut down while
    clients make calls, inhibit shutdown while clients are
    registered, restart when files change on disk during system
    update, ...
  * direct access to SyncEvolution instead having to go through
    the http://api.syncevolution.org D-Bus API

Compilation
===========

Use --enable-dbus-service-pim --enable-pbap --enable-ebook.

--enable-ebook is already the default at the moment. It must not be
  disabled.

The PBAP backend can be disabled. However, then fetching data from
phones via PBAP obviously does not work.

Dependencies
============

A fairly recent libfolks > 0.7.4 is required. The 837a88 commit
is required and several other pending changes are recommended:

https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=686693
writing birthday lacks conversion from UTC

https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=685401
linking by email

https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=686695
support nickname in add_persona_from_details

Other requirements:
* Evolution Data Server >= 3.6
* boost::locale and libphonenumber (when using the default
  sorting and searching)
* glib >= 2.30
* Python >= 2.7 (only for testing)


Known issues
============

None at the moment.


Extending the implementation
============================

Sorting and searching can be replaced with a different implementation
at compile time via --enable-dbus-service-pim[=<locale>]: it uses the
file src/dbus/server/pim/locale-factory-<locale>.cpp to implement
sorting and searching.

Any additional library dependencies for that file need to be added to
the main configure.ac.


Sorting + Searching
===================

The default implementation is based on boost::locale and libphonenumber.
It is documented in pim-manager-api.txt.

Lookup and search are different: the former is based on a valid
number, the later on user input.

A 'phone' lookup can compare normalized numbers including the country
code, to ensure that the lookup is exact and does not mismatch numbers
from different countries. Heuristics like suffix matching do not do
this correctly in all cases.

An 'any-contains' search is based on user input, which might contain
just some digits in the middle of the phone number. The search ignores
formatting in both input and address book.

In both cases, alpha characters are treated as aliases for their
corresponding digit on a keypad when matching phone numbers.

In addition, an empty string as sort order picks a simple, ASCII-based
"last/first" sorting. This is used for testing.

A 'limit' search term with a number as parameter (formatted as string)
can be added to a 'phone' or 'any-contains' search term to truncate the
search results after a certain number of contacts. Example:
  Search([['any-contains', 'Joe'], ['limit', '10']])
  => return the first 10 Joes.

As with any other search, the resulting view will be updated if
contact data changes.

The limit must not be changed in a RefineSearch(). A 'limit' term may
(but doesn't have to) be given. If it is given, its value must match
the value set when creating the search. This limitation simplifies the
implementation and its testing. The limitation could be removed if
there is sufficient demand.


Configuration and data handling
===============================

The configuration of peers is mapped to normal SyncEvolution
configurations. Every peer gets its own context, which contains both
the local source definition for the peer and sync plus target configs.
The special name space prefix "pim-manager-" used to identify them and
avoid potential conflicts with normal SyncEvolution configurations.

Look in ~/.config/syncevolution/pim-manager-* to find the
configuration files.

Local EDS databases are created with a fixed UID and name that also
have that prefix. One could go one step further than it is currently
done and set these databases to "disabled" in the ESourceRegistry,
which would hide them in Evolution.

The SyncEvolution command line can be used to view or manipulate
these databases:
https://syncevolution.org/wiki/item-operations

The persistent configuration of the sort order is stored in
~/.config/syncevolution/pim-manager.ini as the "sort" property. It's
values are the same string as in the API.


Testing
=======

Tests are mostly written in Python. See test/test-dbus.py (base
classes and testing of the normal SyncEvolution D-Bus API) and
src/dbus/server/pim/testpim.py.

These operations manipulate the system address book. To avoid
unexpected data loss when a developer runs the script in his
normal environment, check that testpim.py gets run like this:

  XDG_CONFIG_HOME=`pwd`/temp-testpim/config \
  XDG_DATA_HOME=`pwd`/temp-testpim/local/cache \
  PATH=<SyncEvolution install path>/bin:<SyncEvolution install path>/libexec:$PATH \
       <path to SyncEvolution source>/test/dbus-session.sh \
       <path to SyncEvolution source>/src/dbus/server/pim/testpim.py

This will use temp-testpim in addition to temp-testdbus in the current
directory for temporary files.

If TEST_DBUS_PBAP_PHONE is set to the Bluetooth MAC address (like
A0:4E:04:1E:AD:30) of a phone, PBAP syncing with that phone is tested.

The phone must be paired, connected and support SyncML in addition to
PBAP. The test hard-codes Nokia SyncML settings to keep it simpe and
because Nokia phones are most likely to be used.
